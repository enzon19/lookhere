# LookHere!
Hey, I have a message for you here! LookHere! With this tool, you can create flashy messages to call attention from people near from you in real life.
# Why?
So you are waiting for a Taxi or a Uber, how to tell you are the person waiting? Hmm... this tool help you! That's not the only use! You can talk to someone who don't have the phone number if you have to be fully silent.
# From where this idea come from?
Based on an old app called HailMe for iOS. Unfortunately, I think it's not available anymore.
